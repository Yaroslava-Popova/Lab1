## Description

This project focuses on image processing techniques, specifically rotating images and applying a Gaussian blur filter. The program takes an input image named `input.bmp` from the directory and produces three output images:

output1.bmp: The image rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
output2.bmp: The image rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.
output3.bmp: The image with an applied Gaussian blur filter.

## Build
make

## Run

To run the executable, use the following command:

./image
